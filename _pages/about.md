### Our Values

Raising Awareness - The Foundation works to raise awareness of cryptocurrencies and their potential benefits, as well as to educate the public about the risks and challenges associated with this new technology.

Promoting Adoption - The Foundation encourages the adoption of cryptocurrencies by individuals, businesses, and institutions, and provides support and resources to help facilitate this adoption.

Supporting Development - ​The Foundation supports the development of blockchain technology by funding research and development projects, as well as by providing mentorship and other resources to developers.

Advocating for Policies - The Foundation advocates for policies that promote the growth and global  adoption of cryptocurrencies, and engages with government officials and other stakeholders to help shape these policies.



### Bitcoin
#### Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize much more than just one industry. Here are some potential areas where Bitcoin could make a significant impact:



Financial Inclusion - ​Bitcoin can enable people without access to traditional banking services to participate in the global financial system, as all you need is an internet connection to use Bitcoin. 

Micropayments - ​With Bitcoin, it is possible to send and receive very small payments quickly and cheaply. This could open up new possibilities for content creators and artists to monetize their work, as well as for small businesses to accept payments for low-cost items.

Decentralized Finance - ​Bitcoin is built on a decentralized blockchain, which means that it can be used to create a wide range of financial products and services that operate independently of traditional financial institutions. This has led to the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is a new financial system that uses blockchain technology to provide financial services that are open, transparent, and accessible to everyone.

Supply Chain Management - ​The blockchain technology that underpins Bitcoin can be used to create a transparent and secure supply chain management system. This could enable businesses to track products from the point of origin to the point of sale, which would help to prevent fraud, counterfeiting, and other supply chain problems.

Identity Verification - ​Bitcoin's blockchain technology can be used to create a secure and decentralized system for identity verification. This could help to prevent identity theft and fraud, as well as to make it easier for people to access financial services and other online services that require identity verification.
